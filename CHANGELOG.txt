	- Super: creates 5x5 farmland at 4x produce
	- Mega: creates 7x7 farmland at 8x produce

- Added Super Furnace
	- Cookes 9 different items at the same time
	- Does it at the same fuel cost as a regular furnace
- Added Creative RF Generator (to play around with RF stuff)
- Added Crystal of Greed (yet another useless crafting item, well not so much if you don't want a how of greed).
