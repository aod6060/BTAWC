- Note:
	- This is the final version for 1.7.10 for minecraft. The next release with be for 1.10.2 version of minecraft.
	  The reason why I'm doing this is obious... There is really no point of working on a 1.7.10 mod when there are
	  several new version of minecraft that really needs mods. Plus I really like what they changed in 1.10.2 and 
	  I've played around with it recently so to me its no big deal to changed to that version of minecraft. The next
	  release will pretty much be what this release contains. After that I'll be addeding new features.
	 - Version numbering: I'm going to explain what my version numbering system and how it works. So here is the run
	   down and it goes like this [minecraft-version].[forge-version].[my-build]. For example this version is 1.0.2,
	   1 is for minecraft version 1.7.10, 0 is for forge version, the current version I'm using is 10.13.4.1566, 2 is
	   my second build. Just some information that might help you navagate my alpha for my little silly mod. The next
	   version will be 2.0.0 for 1.10.2 look forward to it. Also if I do a bug fix for my mod it will contain a forth
	   number... For example 1.0.2.1 would be a bug fix build for my mod. ~Cheers derf6060
